# Supervisor Meeting: 2017-10-17

## Done since last meeting

### Finish Core Tools Setup work

TravisCI now tested and working

### Add user input handling

Added command line parsing library logic and also added a library to scan the
user's JSON relative to a validation schema.

### Finish C++ book

Whilst there is still more I can learn about the language, the main job of
getting up to speed is complete.

## Discussion Points

We spoke about the potential to use object-orientation to handle different
types of games. Possibly having one abstract game class which the specific
game types could be subclasses of.

## Future Work

- Converting my existing solving code into a more tidy and object-oriented set
  of classes
- Having a finished and polished black hole solver
